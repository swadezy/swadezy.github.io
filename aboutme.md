### My story

After spending a few years in the corporate world I decided I needed a change. Through thorough soul-searching, I remembered a pivotal period of my middle school career - my time as 'the calculator guy'. Entering 6th grade was an exciting moment not only because it was a 'level-up' into the status of middle schooler, but it also meant I could get my hands on the most exciting tech I could think of... The TI-84 Plus. I voraciously consumed tutorials on TI Basic, the on-board language of the calculator, and became an active member of ticalc.org, publishing a few games I created (my biggest hit was an adaptation of Guitar Hero - unfortunately no sound :/). My expertise became known in school, and I became 'the calculator guy'. Kids knew to come to me when they had issues with their calc, but more excitingly, the **teachers** themselves directed students to come to me with their calculator woes.

All this said, I realized that coding and development was something I loved and had an aptitude for from a young age - I just took a few years off is all.
